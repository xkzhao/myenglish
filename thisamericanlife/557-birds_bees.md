[Act Two](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/557/birds-bees?act=2)

##Prologue

1. I'm taking over today's show because we're talking about questions that I think are pretty fundamental to all of us at various points in our lives but are especially pressing for me these days.

   - pressing: 迫切的

2. Jew:[dʒuː], 犹太人, a person whose religion is Judaism

   - Judaism:[ˈdʒuːdeɪˌɪzəm], the monotheistic(believing that there is only one god) religion of the Jews.
   - Jewish:[ˈdʒuːɪʃ],adj.,  of, relating to, or characteristic of Jews.

3. Because Jews like your great grandparents were driven from their communities by exactly the mentality you've just expressed to me, my 3 and 1/2-year-old boy? Or because we live in a majority Christian country, and I'm worried that I've clearly already failed to provide you with a positive relationship to Judaism? Or is the best approach not to say anything? 

4. anti-Semitic:

   - there's so many rules in this anti-Semitic restaurant.

   - Semitic: Relating to or denoting a family of languages that includes Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic and certain ancient languages such as Phoenician and Akkadian, constituting the main subgroup of the Afro-Asiatic family. 闪族人的

5. The problem with talking to kids about anything that's actually important is that they don't know anything. It's your job to teach them about all of the stuff that matters most, but you have nothing to work with. They don't know religion. They don't know history. They don't know how to maintain proper hygiene. Also a problem, they're little, and they have feelings. So you have to be careful about saying.

6. We've all been on the kid side of this kind of conversion, where a grownup is fumbling through something that is clearly important. The big one most of us remember is when someone told us about sex. And on the adult side, whatever the questions is-- what is sex, what is God, or what is ISIS. what does transgendered mean-- you know in that moment that what you say could really matter, could be the thing this person remembers and carries with them into adulthood, could shape the way they feel about their safety or their sexuality. These conversions are how we make our mark on the next generation. They're also, very often, how we learn how much we do not know. 

7. We're goint to hear teenagers talking very frankly to each other about sex, parents talking to their children about race, and kids talking to each other about death. 

## Act One

1. One way a lot of kids learn about the birds and bees is from each other. 

2. When it comes to sex, a lot of us learn the wrong thing first and the right thing later. You learn through a series of corrections. You start to find out **that** half the things your brother told you were not right, **that** that scene in the movie is not realistic, **that** Sophia was lying when she said she did that thing, because that thing is not possible.

  - 三个从句排比.

3. That's basically our system. You learn things wrong, test them out, and hopefully get the real story from someone named Moxie. This begins on the playground and just continues all the way until you actually start having sex, and all the weird information that was not corrected begins to matter.

4. Deondre is in a classroom at Buffalo State with about 50 other people, mostly men, mostly his fraternity brothers. He's here for some sexed.

5. This is a voluntary workshop about sexual assault and consent, on a Monday night. You'd think this event might not win out over, say, hitting up the Jamba Juice or starting at your van Gogh poster. 

6. This kind of workshop was repeated in classrooms all across campus here and throughtout the country in the last year. College administrators are panicked about sexual assault, as they should be. So they're turning to this kind of education as the answer instead of mostly focusing on protecting women, things like rape whistles or travel with a buddy programs. They also want to teach men actual sentences to say. 

  - panicked: panic的过去分词

7. That kind of messes up the mood. 

8. I'm almoste there. I'm about to go to the drawer to get the protection. 

9. virtuous: [ˈvɜːtʃʊəs] characterized by or possessing virtue or moral excellence; righteous; upright
  
  - They have to learn to speak in this new way because if you don't you're a rapist? Because it's just more virtuous? They have questions right from the start.

10. Does body language count as consent?

11. sober: [ˈsəʊbə]

  - not drunk

12. what if we've been together for a year?

    Paula Madrigal replies, you always need consent, even if you're a woman, even if you're a man sleeping with men, even if you're in a relationship, even if you have sex every day, even if you are in the middle sex.

13. The vast majority of sexual assault on college campuses occur between two people who know each other. 

13. fixate [ˈfɪkseɪt ]

  - to become or cause to become fixed

14. I feel like if we're going to lay the burden on changing the way we talk about sex at the feet of 18-year-olds, people who are already many years into learning weird and bad and confusing information, if that's our answer to reduce sexual assault, I wanted to know more about what these guys actually know and where they learned it.

15. So Nagib is learning how to engage with women from other men who are learning from porn. That's like learning Chinese from a white American in Wyoming. You're missing some key primary source information.

16. solicit: He solicits advice often. 恳求.

17. Every person I talk to who works on sexual assault prevention brought up one thing as particularly troubling about the way men learn about sex, and it wasn't porn. It was baseball, that we talk about sex like it's baseball, getting a home run as a metaphor for sex. They said, think of how many bad lessons are built into that metaphor. You go first base, second base, third base. There's only one direction to move. And a home run is a win. Not to mention, you're on opposing teams. It's competitive. And it's a sport that mostly only men play.

18. gross: 粗野的；恶劣的


## Act Two

1. we are going to step forward from the beginning of life to the murky, complicated middle, the other facts of life that you really don't want to have to explain to children, because you wish they were not facts or a part of life at all.

  - murky:[ˈmɜːkɪ] gloomy or dark. 

2. Some families have hardware stores. My family has thinking about racism.

3. fatherhood: the state or responsibility of being a father.

  - So it's no surprise to me that after I became a parent, I began to do jokes about race and racism and fatherhood.

4. -Have you talked to your daughter about the fact that she's black?   

   -I'm like, no, because she's 3 and 1/2. I don't want to bum her out yet. 

  - I'm like (~ I said). explained: [And I’m like, Quotative ‘like’ isn’t just for quoting](https://stancarey.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/and-im-like-quotative-like-isnt-just-for-quoting/)

  - bum someone out: to disappoint someone. 

5. One night she's like, tonight for dinner, you can have whatever you want. I was like, yay. And she's like, you can stay up all night and watch TV. I was like, yay. And you're black. I was like, hold on a second. That explains everything.

9. I now have two girls, a baby named Juno and an almost four-year-old named Sami. 

10. She really doesn't say much of anything yet.

11. But we have not even put the slightest hint of a Sami toe into the racism pool.

  - toe: 比喻手法。

12. The race pool is filled with positive stories of black achievement, African American role models, books and TV shows featuring diverse characters. 

13. But Sami's racism pool is completely drained with a lock on the gate. And we run past it every day on the way to the race pool. And every day that goes by, I feel guilty. The racism pool is treacherous. It's not fun to swim in.

  - drain: （使）流干， （使）逐渐流走

14. And if you aren't careful, you drown in the sorrow of the black experience in America.

15. This was on my mind recently, how to teach Sami about racism, when this thing happened.

16. I was having a low key celebration, just like I like them.

17. strike down

  - to declare (a law) illegal and unenforceable

  - ex: the Supreme Court struck down the law

18. interracial marriage

19. And if I was going to get into racism with Sami, then the Loving story-- which was about a family like ours-- seemed like a great place to start. ... This was her second time eating there that day after we'd gone there earlier for breakfast.

20. It's not really my kind of place. It's a little bit too impressed with itself, a little too humble braggy about its lattes served in bowls.

29. bus: clear
