##Paragraph 1

**For the last year, I've spent every working day trying to figure out where a high school kid was for an hour after school one day in 1999-- or if you want to get technical about it, and appently I do, where a high school kid was for 21 minutes after school one day in 1999. This search sometimes feels undinified on my part. I've had to ask about teenagers' sex lives, where, how often, with whom, about notes they passed in class, about their drug habits, their relationship with their parents.**
