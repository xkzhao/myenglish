**Activity 3**

Hello, I'm Phil. I live in London. My apartment is close to the Houses of Parliament and I can hear the bells of Big Ben chiming every hour. I live on bus route number 88 which is handy because it takes me to my office in Oxford Circus. What do I do? Well, I'm an author - I write books - but don't worry if you haven't heard of me, my books never sell - ever. In fact I want a caeer change because I desperately need some money. When I pay all my bills, you see, I only have enough spare money to buy a few drinks at my local pub - The Horse and Groom. That reminds me - I've got to go there now to meet some friends. Excuse me, We'll speak again soon.
