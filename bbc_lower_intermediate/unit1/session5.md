**Activity 3**

Hello, I'm Phil. I live in London. My apartment is close to the Houses of Parliament and I can hear the bells of Big Ben chiming every hour. I live on bus route number 88 which is handy because it takes me to my office in Oxford Circus. What do I do? Well, I'm an author - I write books - but don't worry if you haven't heard of me, my books never sell - ever. In fact I want a caeer change because I desperately need some money. When I pay all my bills, you see, I only have enough spare money to buy a few drinks at my local pub - The Horse and Groom. That reminds me - I've got to go there now to meet some friends. Excuse me, We'll speak again soon.

  - I need *more than* that.

*Tom*: It's easy! And how about if I give you the boat - I'll never use it again - you can sell it when you get back. It'll earn you a fortune, on top of the money you get from your travel writing.

*Tom*: Well, you've got to do it in 80 days. I bet you the boat that you won't do it. If you don't do it, I'll keep the boat. If you do sail around the world in 80 days, then you can keep the boat – and you can sell it if you want. He'll never do it!

  - bet: n.&v., bet you the boat.

*Phil*: Hold on. How much have you had to drink? You want me to sail around the world, on my own, in 80 days?! Impossible.

  - hold on：等一等。

*Tom*: I know. But if you want an adventure – and you want to keep the yacht – then that's the challenge. Exactly 80 days to sail all the way around the world – not a minute longer.

*Emily*： Go on Phil, it'll be brilliant. Here, have another drink…

  - have another drink

*John*： Yes, and have my drink too.

  - have my drink

**Activity 4**

One, two. One, two. Is this working? Good.

Hi. I'm Phil. I'm about to sail around the world for the first time in my life. Crazy isn't it?

Now, what's even crazier I have been set the challenge to do it in 80 days. Eight, zero! I've been thinking about some of things I need to take, let me show you.

I have a map. And a compass – north, east, west and south – that's where we're going, south. I also have a satnav. And some food too: non-perishable of course. And some drinking water – very useful! There's plenty of water in the sea but you can't drink it really. Nice and wet.

Speaking of wet, I also have a waterproof jacket. I don't want to get too wet, do I? And, last but not least I have a captain's hat. How do I look?

Now, what other things do you think I might need for such an epic adventure? OK, it's time to set sail. See you later.
