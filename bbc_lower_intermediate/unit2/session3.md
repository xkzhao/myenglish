- It's delightful to talk to you. Talk to me a little about the inspiration for your collection.

- Last fall I think I went right to the edge really with beads, sequins, embroidery, over-the top colour.
  
  - go right to the edge: "the edge" is a metaphor. It is used to evoke an image of pushing oneself to the point just before failure to achieve a goal, in other words, to the point just before falling off of an actual precipice. 

  - beads: small pieces of wood, glass or other material with holes in them, often used in jewellery

  - sequins – small, shiny disk sewn as one of many onto clothing for decoration

  - embroidery – patterns made by sewing into cloth. 
  
  - over-the-top: very extreme

- Last spring I pull back a little bit but still quite over-the-top. And I think the natural thing as a fashion designer, or at least for me, is always to think: what am I tired of, what do I want to see more of, How am I feeling now? And the natural reaction is to kind of pull back to maybe a quiter luxury that's really all about the shape, all about the line, all about the fabrics, the workmanship. 

  - to pull back – to move away from (something)
  - workmanship: 手艺,手工
  - ostentatious: clearly showing wealth or power

- I love London. I've loved London for years. My assistants for years have been English. I love the British, I like the formality. And I alos like the crazy, eccentric side. I think the people here are the most interesting people in the world. It's where I want to live, It's 
 where I have my life, it's where my son will go to school, so I'm very happy to be here.
